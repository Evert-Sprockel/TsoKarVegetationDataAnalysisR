# Tso Kar vegetation - data analysis R project
This project contains the R scripts that produce the results (intermediate data sets, graphs, etc.) for my thesis on high-altitude wetland vegetation in Tso Kar, Ladakh, India. This project was carried out from March 2024 to January 2025 at the chair group Plant Ecology and Nature Conservation at Wageningen University & Research, in collaboration with WWF-India.

## Reproducing the results
The file main.R describes the requirements for re-running this project. The outputs of the scripts are already stored in the results folder.
